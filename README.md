week 12 Employee Tracker

This week our challenge was to create a command line application that would create a company database and track employees. This was done using inquirer and postgresql. A database is created using postgresql and employees are entered into the database. Once a user runs the schema and seeds files and does a node index.js, they are brought to a menu where they can do various tasks. 

This challenge gave me a bunch of trouble and i was finding a lot of different ways to do it on the internet so by the end im not 100 percent sure that this is exactly how it was suppposed to be done but once i finally got it working i did not want to mess it up again.
